They look like a bunch of idiots to him. But a bhakti yogi, a devotee, thinks all this gnana, karma and kriya yoga is a waste of time. He pities the others who don\u2019t see that when God is here, all you need to do is hold His hand and walk. All this mind-splitting philosophy, this bone-bending yoga, is not needed; God is here, because God is everywhere. Then there is the karma yogi, the man of action. He thinks all the other types of yogis, with their fancy philosophies, are just lazy. But a kriya yogi is the most disdainful of all. He laughs at everyone. Don\u2019t they know that all of existence is energy? If you don\u2019t transform your energy, whether you long for God or you long for anything else, nothing is going to happen. There will be no transformation. These four people customarily can\u2019t get along. But today they happened to be walking together in the forest and a storm broke out. It grew very intense and began raining heavily. They started running, looking for shelter. The bhakti yogi, the devotion man, said, \u201cIn this direction there is an ancient temple. Let\u2019s go there.\u201d He\u2019s a devotee; he knows the geography of temples very well! They all ran in that direction. They came to an ancient temple. All the walls had crumbled long ago; just the roof and four columns remained. They rushed into the temple; not out of love for God, but just to escape the rain. There was a deity in the center. They ran towards it. The rain was lashing down from every direction. There was no other place to go, so they moved closer and closer. Finally, there was no alternative. They just hugged the deity and sat down. The moment these four people hugged the idol, there was a huge fifth presence. Suddenly, God appeared. In all their four minds the same question arose: Why now? They wondered, \u201cWe expounded so many philosophies, did so many poojas, served so many people, did so much body-breaking sadhana, but you didn\u2019t come.

That is not what we are referring to here. Yoga simply means to be in perfect tune. When you are in yoga, your body, mind and energy and existence are in absolute harmony. When your body and mind are in a relaxed state and at a certain level of blissfulness, you can be free of so many nagging ailments. Let us say, you go and sit in your office with a nagging headache. Your headache is not a major disease, but just that throbbing could take away some of your enthusiasm for work and perhaps some of your capability for that day. But with the practice of yoga, your body and mind can be kept at the highest possible peak. The word \u201cyoga\u201d literally means \u201cunion.\u201d When you experience everything as one in your consciousness, then you are in yoga. To attain to that unity within you, there are many ways. For example, there is hatha yoga. Hatha yoga means you start with the body. The body itself has its own attitudes, its own ego, its own nature. Apart from your mind, do you see, your body has its own ego? Suppose you say, \u201cFrom tomorrow, I want to get up at five in the morning and walk on the beach.\u201d You set the alarm. The alarm rings. You want to get up but your body says, \u201cShut up and sleep.\u201d It has its own way. So we start with the body. Hatha yoga is a way of working with the body, disciplining the body, purifying the body, and preparing the body for higher levels of energy. All of us are alive, all of us are human beings. But all of us do not experience life to the same intensity because our pranic energies are not the same. Different people experience life in different levels of intensity. For example, someone sees a tree. A tree is just a tree. Most people don\u2019t even see it. Somebody sees the tree in more detail. An artist sees every shade of it. Someone else not only sees the tree but also sees the divine in it. Seeing is not the same because the level of intensity with which you experience life is not the same. The whole process of yoga is to take you from something that you know, and take the next step into the unknown. We have made this yogic science almost like a physical science. Suppose you mix two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen, you get water. Even when a great scientist puts it together, it is water. Even if an idiot puts it together, it is only water. Similarly, in yoga too, whether a great yogi does it or an ignorant person does it, it does not matter. If he does the practices and sadhana properly, the result is there to be seen. In yoga, these systems have been identified. To start with, you work with the body, then you move to the breath, then to the mind, then to the inner self. Like this many steps have been created. They are only different aspects. They are not really different types of yoga. In fact, we address all of them at once. It is important that in a very balanced way all of them are addressed at once, as one unit. Otherwise, if you work just with the body, it is only preparatory in nature. So, there is really no division as such.

A few years ago when I was in America, I was invited to speak in a yoga studio by someone. So I went to her yoga studio and music was playing \u2013 chang, chang, chang \u2013 to keep everybody enthusiastic. She was in ardhamatsyendrasana and was talking to a group of people. When she saw me, she just jumped up from the table, came and hugged me. I took her aside and told her, \u201cSee, you will bring serious imbalances into your system. How long have you been doing this?\u201d She said some fifteen, sixteen years. I said, \u201cIf you\u2019ve done this for sixteen years, you must be suffering from this, this and this.\u201d She looked at me terrified and the next day she comes to me and says, \u201cSadhguru, what you said has been happening to me. I\u2019m going through all sorts of treatment from the doctors.\u201d I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need a doctor, you are causing it. You stop this, this will go away.\u201d After about one-and-a-half years, she gave up teaching yoga. A lot of people who have done improper yoga have lost their mental balance.
